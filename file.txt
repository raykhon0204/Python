at line 1 readline() method takes each line from the file and stores it in a list
This list then stored in lines, which we can cintinue to work with after the with
block ends. At line 2 we use a simple for loop to print each line from lines.
Because each items in lines corresponds to each line in the file, the 
out put matches the contents of the file exactly

Working with a File's contents
We start by opening the file and stoting each line of text in a list,
just as we did in the previous example. At line 1 we create a variable, file_string
to hold the text of file.txt. We then create a loop that adds each line of text to 
file_string and remove the newline character from each line 2. At 3 we print 
this string and also show how long the string is.
