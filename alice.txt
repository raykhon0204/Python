ACT I
SCENE ONE
Alice’s home. Lewis Carroll is discovered, playing chess. Golden-haired Alice, in a little blue dress, a black kitten in her arms, stands watching him.
Alice
That’s a funny game, uncle. What did you do then?
arroll
A red pawn took a white pawn; this way. You see, Alice, the chessboard is divided into sixty-four squares, red and white, and the white army tries to win and the red army tries to win. It’s like a battle!
Alice
With soldiers?
Carroll
Yes, here are the Kings and Queens they are fighting for. That’s the Red Queen and here’s the White Queen.
Alice
How funny they look!
Carroll
See the crowns on their heads, and look at their big feet.
Alice
It’s a foot apiece, that’s what it is! Do they hump along like this?
Carroll
ere! You’re spoiling the game. I must keep them all in their right squares.
AliceI want to be a queen!
CarrolHere you are [he points to a small white pawn] here you are in your little stiff skirt!
Alice How do you do, Alice!
Carroll And now you are going to move here.
Alice Let me move myself.
